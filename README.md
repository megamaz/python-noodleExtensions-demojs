# noodleExtensions-python
If you'd much rather use python over JS, then this is *exactly* this.\
This repo is a copy of the `demo.js` found inside the Noodle Extensions documentation map.\
# Side note
- The `demo.js` uses `.push`. In python, use `.append`

# Documentation map
This is a ~~JS~~ PY script used to generate the map seen in the documentation of noodle extensions. Most of it should be self explanatory, it requires ~~nodeJS~~ python to run.
